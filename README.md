# Hacker Rank - 3 months preparation kit

Hacker rank code playground is slow and I do not really like.
So, I decided to work locally and execute my code with Deno who has
TypeScript support out of the box

execute code with [deno](https://deno.land/#installation) with this command:
`deno run path/file.ts`
